# parallel_layers

### `check_sentences_voice_ridge_regression`
* output files directory for debugging issue 1 in pickle_linear_human_mse.py (see probing/ README). We only plotted voicetype conditions because it was enough to see the issue. 

### `check_sentences_trialtype`
* same debugging directory as `check_sentences_voice_ridge_regression` above, but the files weren't used for plotting because we found the issue.

### `human_predictions`
* output files directory for `pickle_linear_human_mse.py` or `pickle_linear_human_r_squared.py`

### `model_human_ceiling`
* output files directory for `human_predict_plausibility.py`

### `new_layers`
* output files directory for `pickle_newsplit_automatic.py`

### `human_plausibility_ceilings.csv`
* combined long-form file of files in `model_human_ceiling` above

### `model_plausibility_with_ceiling.csv.csv`
* combined long-form file of files in `new_layers` and `model_human_ceiling` above
