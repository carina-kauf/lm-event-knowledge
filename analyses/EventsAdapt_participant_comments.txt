The sentence I was least sure how to answer was:The wizard was protected by the gnome.as the directions said plausible in the real world.

Some of these sentences were tricky because they were plausible, just highly unlikely in some cases. I answered as well as I could.

Thank you for allowing me to participate! Tried using the instructions of what is plausible of commonly occurring but some of the examples stumped me. Many were very clear though. Ones such as the president pardoned the traitor, might be viewed by many as not common, but as of recently especially in the past few years, others may say it is indeed common.
This was a fun hit. It was more difficult than i thought and really had to think about things. I enjoyed it, thank you!

Sentence: The service rated the cheapskate.This one used to be implausible, but now it happens often.

page loaded fine, no technical issues
great survey.
None, thank you!
an engaging survey.
Depending on the positions of the two subject nouns in the sentence, if one had a more prestigious position for example, I gave the sentence less likely or more likely to be credible depending upon who was helping whom. Thx

It was very interesting to do
There were a few words used in the questions that I didn't know and had to look up online (mollified). I consider myself someone who has a rich, native English language and been speaking it since birth and found the vocabulary a bit hard to understand.

Interesting study, I liked it!
I rated the sorcerer/dwarf, as well as the pixie one implausible because the instructions say "real world" sorry if this is incorrect.

THE SURVEY VERY IMPORTAN
it is very interesting survey
Its best experience in this survey.
I thought some of the sentences were obvious and easy to answer like "the jam was loathed by the dietician" (completely implausible).  But, I thought many of the sentences were subjective like "the lad instructed the governess".  I rated this as somewhat plausible because children occasionally understand or know more about a subject than their teacher.

Nice hit, thanks.

I'm not sure about the sentences with the spirits/ghosts: those make sense grammatically and would make sense in context (e.g., a novel about the paranormal), but they're not plausible in the sense that ghosts aren't real. I wasn't sure how we were supposed to rate those questions.

A lot of these seemed bizarre and unlikely to happen, but I answered them according to how POSSIBLE they are to happen.  I also do not see a code box for Red Forest (the code...I guess?) so I'll type it here. Red Forest. Thank you!

I think there was one ambiguous sentence, "The confectioner was sprinkled by the sugar." The sugar can't actively sprinkle itself on them, but this could be read in a passive tone.

THE SURVEY IS VERY GOOD
I feel like I am going to not get credit for this, because there were some weird scenarios that I felt were completely plausible. I don't see any reason why they couldn't or wouldn't happen. In general I don't think there is a scale for plausibility; either something could happen or it couldn't. And I am really not sure about the fairy one. Was it a trick? Would you say it's implausible because fairies and trolls don't exist, or is it plausible in an assumed world where they do? Because if fairies and trolls exist, it is certainly plausible that a fairy could enchant a troll. Anyway, I took this all seriously. I hope my possible odd take on some things won't make you think I answered at random, and reject my HIT.
very good survey

It seems like this should have been yes or no questions instead of a scale, but because it was a scale I tried using more that 1 or 7. Please know I tried on this and needed the dictionary to look up some words.
There were a few of these that were quite tricky but please know that I did the best I could and went with my gut as instructed.  Thanks for the HIT!

Good pay, thank you. I almost answered a couple as plausible until remembering it was supposed to be real world related (Orc and Sorcerer sentences). Some seemed plausible though unlikely so a scale was useful. Like usually a rebel won't exile a king, but revolutions totally happen.

Some of these sentences could potentially be plausible in the right situation, so hopefully a hard yes or no isn't required for those answers, otherwise the 7 point scale is misleading.

Might I suggest using somewhat more memorable for your survey codes? "Red forest" is not all that memorable, but something like "scowling marmoset" is. For those of us who work on mTurk a lot, it's difficult to remember all the HITs we've completed. Memorable names would help.

I'd prefer it if you used "Choose Number X" for your attention checks than left/right. Gives me more anxiety.

Some of the sentences could have been plausible if interpreted a different way e.g. "The doctor was closed by the school". People can refer to the doctors office as the doctor and the office could be by the school. But I tried to avoid interpretations where the grammar would be messy
