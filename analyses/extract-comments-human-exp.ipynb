In general I don't think there is a scale for plausibility; either something could happen or it couldn't. And I am really not sure about the fairy one. Was it a trick? Would you say it's implausible because fairies and trolls don't exist, or is it plausible in an assumed world where they do? Because if fairies and trolls exist, it is certainly plausible that a fairy could enchant a troll. Anyway, I took this all seriously.
